    /// Distinct queries return documents that are distinct with a page.
    /// This means that documents are not guaranteed to be distinct across continuations and partitions.
    /// The reasoning for this is because the backend treats each continuation of a query as a separate request
    /// and partitions are not aware of each other.
    /// The solution is that the client keeps a running hash set of all the documents it has already seen,
    /// so that when it encounters a duplicate document from another continuation it will not be emitted to the user.
    /// The only problem is that if the user chooses to go through the continuation token API for DocumentQuery instead
    /// of while(HasMoreResults) ExecuteNextAsync, then will see duplicates across continuations.
    /// There is no workaround for that use case, since the continuation token will have to include all the documents seen.
